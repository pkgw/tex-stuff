Peter Williams' helpful LaTeX files. These include:

- [yahapj.bst](docs/yahapj.md), an ApJ-like BibTeX style that properly shows
  Arxiv identifiers and hyperlinks to DOI or ADS pages.
- *affils.sty*, a package for auto-numbering affiliations in long author
  lists.
- *scgraphic.sty*, a package for quickly and configurably making a figure with
  a caption to its side.

Less fascinatingly cool files include:

- *pwterse-ay.bst*, a terse author-year BibTeX style (useful for proposals).
- *pwterse.bst*, a terse numbered BibTeX style (for proposals where you're
  really trying to save as much space as you possibly can).
- *yansf.bst*, a NSF-compatible BibTeX style that inserts hyperlinks and Arxiv
  information like [yahapj.bst](docs/yahapj.md).
